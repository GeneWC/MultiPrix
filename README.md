# MultiPrix

A educational Racing game created by Gene Chang, James Gleadall, Johan Shyju, and Justin Vo

Our game, MultiPrix Action Racing, is a high-action racing game that incorporates mathematics with exciting competition with friends! Up to 4 players put their math skills against each other to reach the finish line first! The Math Grand Prix consists of 3 randomly chosen race tracks. Throughout the race, your car speed varies: answering math questions correctly increases your speed, while staying idle and getting questions incorrect decreases your speed.
